Create the Student table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Student (
    roll_no NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(50),
    marks NUMBER
);
Insert values into the Student table:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Student (roll_no, name, marks) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 85);
INSERT INTO Student (roll_no, name, marks) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 90);
INSERT INTO Student (roll_no, name, marks) VALUES (3, 'Alice Brown', 78);
-- Continue with more inserts as needed.
Add a new attribute date_of_birth to the Student table using the ALTER statement:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE Student ADD (date_of_birth DATE);
Drop the date_of_birth attribute from the Student table:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE Student DROP COLUMN date_of_birth;
Update the marks of a student where roll_no is 7:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Student
SET marks = 88  -- Replace 88 with the desired mark
WHERE roll_no = 7;
Delete a record of a student whose roll_no is 4:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE roll_no = 4;
Create a view for the Student table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW Student_View AS
SELECT * FROM Student;
Create an index on roll_no in the Student table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_roll_no ON Student (roll_no);
Create a sequence for the Student table (useful for generating unique roll numbers):

sql
Copy code
CREATE SEQUENCE student_seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1
NOCACHE;
Create a synonym for the Student table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE SYNONYM student_synonym FOR Student;
